        <p> // WASP48B IS INHABITED BY CRAB PEOPLE. // </p>
        <p>This myth originated from the highly acclaimed video game <a href='www.superpaintergirl.com' style='color: #bbc6ce;'>Crab People From Planet 48b</a>. The truth, however, is that we simply do not know enough about 48b to confirm or deny the presence
            of crab people.</p>

        <p> // WASP48B IS MADE OF CHEESE // </p>
        <p>The origins of this myth are unknown. There is insufficient evidence to support this widely circulated claim. Researchers have, however, pointed out that the planetâ€™s atmospheric conditions would make any cheese on 48b taste downright nasty.</p>

        <p> // WASP48B IS CLOSER TO CONNECTICUT THAN FLORIDA // </p>
        <p>This popular myth is about perspective. It is indeed true that can see WASP-48b from a telescope in Connecticut, but you cannot see Florida. However, this does not mean WASP-48b is closer. This is because the earth is flat -- and while you can
            look up from the earth, you cannot look across it.</p>
